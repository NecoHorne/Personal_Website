                    <p class="lead">My name is Neco Horne. I was born and raised in Johannesburg South Africa. From a young age I have always been an obsessive person, be it with books, games, music or any new skill that I wanted to learn. I would spend hours dedicated to the object of my current obsession. I have always been interested in science, engineering and technology. My career started as a Quality Control Inspector on the NMPP project for State owned entity Transnet. Being driven and focused, my career goals were soon set; I was going to become a Project Quality Manager before the age of 25. My career obsession was to reach this goal, and at the age of 25 I reached my goal - becoming Project Quality Manager for the second largest construction project in the world.</p>

                    <p class="lead">Having reached my goal I had a "now what?" moment. I was no longer interested, nor fulfilled in my chosen career or position. I started looking for something that I enjoy doing; something I can see myself making a creative career out of. At the age of 28, I decided to make a career change. I enjoyed the in depth data analysis of the project metrics involved with my Quality career, specifically writing formulas and functions for analysis in excel; and so my interest in coding and development was born.
